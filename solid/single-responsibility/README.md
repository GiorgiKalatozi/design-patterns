Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in TypeScript

Overview

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility or job. In other words, a class should have a single, well-defined purpose.

Simply put, it states that a class should have only one reason to change. This principle aims to enhance code maintainability, readability, and testability.
